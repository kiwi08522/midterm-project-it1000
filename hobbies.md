### My Hobbies

Click [**here**](README.md) to go back.

I enjoy spending summer weekends at the Lake of the Ozarks. I'll fish, boat, jet ski, and enjoy nice weather. I am from St. Louis, MO, and I'll ride around on motorcycles, either dirt bikes or street bikes, whenever it's nice. Most of my hobbies are in the summer. In the winter, I am more _relaxed_ and spend less time outdoors.
