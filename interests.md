### My Interests in Technology

Click [**here**](README.md) to go back.

My interests, technically speaking, and why I am majoring in Information Technology, is because of my desire to learn different programming languages and understand how computers work. I enjoy the satisfaction of diagnosing technical problems and coming up with creative fixes to solve whatever I am working on. I've been attempting to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and other languages for some time now. [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) has been a major help.
